# scholarship_logtime
Hi there !  
I made a program that calculates the total logtime from the 27th to the 26th of the chosen month to the nearest second with and without the bonus logtime if there's any.  
You have to do 140 hours between those dates to complete the attendance requirements of the GEN scholarship.
Therefore, the bonus logtime is the extra hours you did !  
**Note that you can only cumulate up to _70 hours_ of bonus logtime and it's only applicable for the next month !**
