<h1 align="center"> scholarship_logtime</h1>

Hello there !

Here's my first personal project which is a program that may be interesting to **GEN scholarship students**:  
It calculates the total logtime a person has done from the 27th to the 26th of the current month, counting bonus time from the previous month if there is any !
The program also tells you how many days are left and how many hours per day you should do before the 26th. Else, it tells you the bonus hours that will apply for the next month.   

**Note that you can only cumulate up to _70 hours_ of bonus logtime and it's only applicable for the next month !**

**If the logs of the day are not displayed, you have to wait until midnight.**

**The program doesnâ€™t calculate manually added logtimes (not sure).**

## Installation

Git clone my repo !

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Nonino42/scholarship_logtime.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd scholarship_logtime
```

## Configuration

### Ruby

To run this project, you will have to install Ruby if it's not installed yet. Note that on mac it is already pre-installed. To check it, do:

```bash
  which ruby
```

You should get something like

```bash
  /usr/bin/ruby
```

Else, follow [this link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

**Note that at school, you don't have the permission to change versions, or add and install gems so please follow the next command lines to install rbenv:**

```bash
  curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```

Once you have installed rbenv, it should tell you how to configure your shell to load rbenv and the command should look **_something like this_**:
```bash
  echo 'eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
Or if you don't find the command please follow this [link](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

Then restart your terminal or simply _exec zsh_ and do
```bash
  rbenv install 2.6.10
  rbenv global 2.6.10
```

Now when you do _ruby -v_ you should get the version you just installed.

Once you have it, run the following command line in scholarship_logtime/ to create your **Gemfile**:

```bash
  bundle init
```

Now we need the **Gemfile.lock** to add dependencies we need in our program.

```bash
  bundle add oauth2
  bundle add scanf
  bundle install
```

### API

As the program needs to access the 42 API, you will have to create an application v2 in your intra.

For that, go on your intra, click on your profile, settings, API, register a new app at the top right on your screen.

- **Name** = _scholarship_logtime_

- **Redirect URI** = _https://profile.intra.42.fr/_

The others you can skip.

Now you should have your **_UID_** and your **_SECRET_**

Now go back to your terminal and add the following environment variables with the _export_ command:

```bash
  export UID_42="UID_of_your_application"
  export SECRET_42="SECRET_of_your_application"
```
## You are finally good to go !

Now execute the program by using the simple command line:

```bash
  ./sslog.sh your_42_login
```
